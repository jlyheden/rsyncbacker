# initial idea

time machine in osx is not flexible enough and slow, thus this "script" aims to:

* run rsync backups unattended (ie cron) on laptops (only care about osx for now)
* allow post hooks (such as triggering snapshot in freenas)
* optional to only trigger when being on same lan as backup target
